# Calculator

## Goals:
- [ ] Your calculator needs to contain functions for all basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators.`+ - * /`
- [ ] Create a new function `operate` that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.
- [ ] Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit and each of the above functions.
- [ ] Add an "equals" & "clear" button.
- [ ] Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons.
- [ ] Make the calculator work! Use previous DOM lessons learned and the functions you just created.

**Watch out for and fix these bugs if they show up in your code:**

- [ ] Make sure user should be able to string together several operations and get right answer. example: `12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = 42`
- [ ] Answers should round that have long decimals so that they don't overflow the screen.
- [ ] Pressing "clear" should wipe out any existing data.. make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing "clear"
- [ ] Display an error message if the user tries to divide by 0. Don't let it crash your calculator!

**Extra Credit**

- [ ] Add a ` . ` button and let users input decimals!
- [ ] Make the calculator look nice!
- [ ] Add a `backspace` button.
- [ ] Add keyboard support!
